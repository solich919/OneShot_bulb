# LM3410 led driver
The contents of this folder hold KiCad project files for LM3410 led driver prototype.
The main problem associated with the project is to generate ~22V from a Li-on cell and hold constant current at around 200 mA to drive the LED filament.
LM3410 from TI fits these requirements. A prototype was made to test the validity of this design.
